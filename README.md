# World_Weather_Analysis

In this project, weather descriptions have to be added and retrieved. Beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between four cities will be created as well as a marker layer map.
